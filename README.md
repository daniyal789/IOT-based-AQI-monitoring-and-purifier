# IOT-based-AQI-monitoring-and-purifier

Summary:

This project presents a prototype for an Internet of Things (IoT) solution designed to monitor and enhance Air Quality Index (AQI). The prototype integrates gas sensors for measuring CO2, CO, O3, and NO2, as well as dust sensors for PM2.5 and PM10. Operating as a standalone system on a microcontroller (Arduino Uno), the prototype processes real-time data and activates an intelligent air purifier(exhaust fan combined with filter for this prototype module) in response to AQI levels, showcasing the feasibility and potential of the concept.

Key Features:

1-> Gas and dust sensor integration for comprehensive AQI monitoring.
2-> Real-time data processing on a microcontroller, illustrating a standalone prototype.
3-> Smart air purifier activation based on predefined AQI thresholds.

Usage:

1->Connect gas and dust sensors to the microcontroller (Arduino/Raspberry Pi).
2->Deploy the prototype in the target environment for comprehensive AQI monitoring.
3-> Observe real-time AQI data and the dynamic response of the air purifier in prototype mode.

Dependencies:

1-> Gas sensors (e.g., MQ series) and dust sensors.
2-> Microcontroller (Arduino/Raspberry Pi) with processing capabilities.
3->Optional: External power source for prolonged operation.
